"""Lightweight integration test: SparkKubernetesOperator (Kubeflow Spark Operator), run once
locally and once against this tenant's remote cluster. Submits spark-pi via spark/spark_pi.yaml
and waits for completion with SparkKubernetesSensor.

NOTE: unlike KubernetesPodOperator, neither SparkKubernetesOperator nor SparkKubernetesSensor
accepts an `in_cluster` kwarg directly - only `kubernetes_conn_id` (default "kubernetes_default").
For the local tasks we deliberately pass no connection at all: KubernetesHook's own fallback for
the literal "kubernetes_default" conn id is an empty Connection, which resolves to in-cluster
config automatically (verified against the installed provider's source, not assumed).

# SparkApplication object names are "it-spark-pi-{suffix}-{ts_nodash}" - ts_nodash comes from
# `spark/spark_pi.yaml`'s own `{{ ts_nodash | lower }}`, rendered by Airflow's standard templating
# of application_file (application_file is a real templated_field with template_ext including
# "yaml", so its content gets the full per-task Jinja context, confirmed against the installed
# provider's source - not the DAG-parse-time uuid this file used to compute). ts_nodash derives
# from the dag run's logical_date, so every task in one run renders the identical value -
# `application_name` below uses the exact same expression so wait_local/wait_remote poll for the
# object that was actually created, not a name only one task's own Python process ever knew about
# (confirmed locally: a module-level `uuid.uuid4()` looked deterministic but is independently
# re-evaluated in every task's own pod, since each task re-imports this file from scratch - so
# submit_local and wait_local silently disagreed on the name almost every run).
