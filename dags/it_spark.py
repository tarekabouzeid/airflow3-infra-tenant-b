"""Lightweight integration test: SparkKubernetesOperator (Kubeflow Spark Operator), run once
locally and once against this tenant's remote cluster. Submits spark-pi via spark/spark_pi.yaml
and waits for completion with SparkKubernetesSensor.

NOTE: unlike KubernetesPodOperator, neither SparkKubernetesOperator nor SparkKubernetesSensor
accepts an `in_cluster` kwarg directly - only `kubernetes_conn_id` (default "kubernetes_default").
For the local tasks we deliberately pass no connection at all: KubernetesHook's own fallback for
the literal "kubernetes_default" conn id is an empty Connection, which resolves to in-cluster
config automatically (verified against the installed provider's source, not assumed).

# Kueue lane for each submission, rendered into spark/spark_pi.yaml's metadata.labels as
# kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name. "high" draws on this tenant's guaranteed quota, "low" runs
# opportunistically on borrowed idle capacity and is the first thing evicted. Split across the two
# submissions below so one DAG run exercises both of this tenant's ClusterQueues.
#
# What this label does NOT control is gang scheduling, which is cluster-wide and platform-owned:
# whichever lane is chosen, Kueue suspends the SparkApplication until the driver and ALL executors
# fit at once. A Spark job here never half-starts with a driver holding capacity its executors are
# still queueing for. See the platform repo's docs/runbook-governance.md.

# SparkApplication object names are "it-spark-pi-{suffix}-{sanitized run_id}". run_id (not
# ts_nodash/ds/ts) is the only per-run identifier guaranteed present: get_template_context()
# (airflow.sdk.execution_time.task_runner) only adds ts_nodash and friends when
# dag_run.logical_date is truthy, and a schedule=None DAG triggered without an explicit logical
# date gets logical_date=None in Airflow 3 - confirmed locally, {{ ts_nodash }} raised
# "UndefinedError: 'ts_nodash' is undefined" here for exactly that reason. run_id is sanitized
# (colons/plus/dots/underscores -> '-', lowercased) because Airflow's own default manual run_id
# ("manual__2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00") isn't a valid Kubernetes object name otherwise. This
# expression is duplicated verbatim in spark/spark_pi.yaml's `name:` field (rendered there via
# application_file, a real templated_field with template_ext including "yaml" - confirmed against
# the installed provider's source) and in application_name below, so wait_local/wait_remote poll
# for the exact object submit_local/submit_remote actually created. A module-level
# `uuid.uuid4()` was tried first and looked deterministic but is independently re-evaluated in
# every task's own pod (each task re-imports this file from scratch), so submit_local and
# wait_local silently disagreed on the name almost every run - run_id/ts_nodash-style values work
# because Airflow computes them once per dag run and injects the same value into every task's
# context, not because they're computed in this file.
